**Key Requirements:**

1. PS4 firmware version 1.76 or earlier
2. Minimum 8GB USB drive
3. Fedora Live ISO
4. PS4 Radeon drivers
5. VirtualBox for Windows
6. ArchiveZilla

**Installation Process:**

1. Run Fedora Live ISO in VirtualBox
2. Partition the USB drive and install Fedora
3. Reinstall PS4 Radeon drivers
4. Configure network settings and IP address
5. Install Steam and other necessary software

**Challenges and Limitations:**

1. PS4 hardware is proprietary and optimized for gaming, not PC use
2. Graphics processing unit (GPU) is similar to AMD Radeon HD 7850, but an APU (Accelerated Processing Unit) like AMD A10, which may not be compatible with standard PC graphics drivers
3. Limited hardware resources, such as RAM and storage, compared to modern PCs
4. No support for standard PC peripherals, like keyboards and mice, without additional configuration
5. Potential stability and performance issues due to the modified OS and hardware configuration
